# NorMuon
Official Implementation for [NorMuon paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05491)

## Code
We release our implementation in normuon.py, modified from the original [Muon](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon/tree/master) code. For a distributed version, we've made a PR to the [Dion](https://github.com/microsoft/dion/pull/19) codebase.
We also make a PR to the modded-nanogpt [here](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt/pull/141).

NorMuon is also used in the recent [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) project!

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/zichongli5/NorMuon.git
```


## Usage

Usage mirrors the original [Muon](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon/tree/master) optimizer; please refer to their examples and details.
